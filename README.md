Piggybooth
==========

A compact, simple photobooth, designed to work with a gphoto2 compatible DSLR
and an arduino-based serial button.

In it's current configuration, when someone presses the button, it'll take a
series of 3 photos, insert them into a template image (examples are supplied),
then prompt for an email address to send the image. It also keeps a copy
locally, so you can put the whole lot up somewhere yourself, if you like.

I've used this across a few events, with reasonably good success, and lots of
happy users :)

My setup was:
- Inspiron Laptop, running Ubuntu
- External 1280x1024 monitor, configured in portrait
- External keyboard
- Canon EOS 600D
- Arduino "Big red button"
